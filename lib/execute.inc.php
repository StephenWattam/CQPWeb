/**
 * 
 * @file
 * 
 * Script that allows superusers direct access to the function library via the URL / get method.
 * 
 * in the format:
 * 
 * execute.php?function=foo&args=["string"#1#2]&locationAfter=[index.php?thisQ=search]&uT=y
 * 
 * (note that everything within [] needs to be url-encoded for non-alphanumerics)
 * 
 *    
 * ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * =======================
 * 
 * It is quite possible to **break CQPweb** using this script.
 * 
 * It has been written on the assumption that anyone who is a superuser is sufficiently
 * non-idiotic to avoid doing so.
 * 
 * If for any given superuser this assumption is false, then that is his/her/your problem.
 * 
 * Not CQPweb's.
