NOTES on JavaScript
===================

- Please note that as of v3.1.9, all CQPweb pages require the jQuery library.
- jQuery is provided internally, rather than being downloaded from an external source.
  - Advantages: we are programing against a known version (1.11.1 as of most recently),
    actual internet connection not needed, we can update the internal copy at intervals
    of our own choice.
  - Disadvantages: there is a (one-time) large download.
