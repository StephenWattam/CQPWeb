Look in the "doc" folder for files which contain information on how to install CQPweb.

Your attention is drawn in particular to "doc/CQPwebAdminManual.pdf"!

The manual is also available online from http://cwb.sourceforge.net/documentation.php .


LICENCES
--------

- CQPweb's own licence is GPL v2. See LICENCE.TXT.

- CQPweb interfaces with, but does not incorporate, elements of the IMS OPEN CORPUS WORKBENCH. This is likewise under GPL v2. 

- CQPweb interfaces with, but does not incorporate, the R statistical programming environment. This is likewise under GPL v2.

- CQPweb incorporates the following components:

   - (part of) the Linux Libertine font. This is under GPL v2 with added font exception, see css/img/LinLibertine_LICENSE.txt
   
   - wz_tooltip.js. This is under LGPL v2.1. See the header of that file.
   
   - the jQuery library. This is under the MIT Licence, aka the X11 Licence. See the header of that file.

To the best of our understanding all incorporated components are under licences compatible with the main CQPweb licence (GPL v2).
